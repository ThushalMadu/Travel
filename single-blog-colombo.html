                            <p class="excert">
                                Some cities come to life in the night, and when it comes to nightlife in Colombo, the city-state practically transforms itself from an ever-so-efficient business hub to a buzzing network of restaurants, bars and night clubs just when the sunsets by its coastal lines. Colombo perhaps is not just a city, it’s an epitome of a lifestyle.
Let the sun go down and you will see the thrill we are about to take you through.

The best nightlife in Colombo is centered around the city center, meaning that you can quite easily have a jump start meal down park street mews, unwind for its live music, head to Love Bar for a cocktail and dance the night away at R&B – all in the same evening.

Convenience is not Colombo’s only strong point either. Its new restaurants are meant for glorious taste buds. Colombo night life brings on a plethora of restaurants to foodies. And yes, the nightclubs and pubs, not to mention some spectacular rooftop bars that keep popping up around the city, as well as all the best venues as we have pointed you in the direction of the liveliest after-dark areas, are your best choices for a night you decide to spend in Colombo.

Here’s few of the best Colombo night life hangout spots you MUST try and the latest additions with no doubt spectacular.
								<br/>
								<h1>1.Ask for Fern</h1><br/>
							<img src="img/Ask_for_Fern_Sri_Lanka.jpg" alt=""> <br/>
							Can’t think of a better place to have the best experience of Colombo night life, that blends a stunning ambience with favorable indoor and outdoor seating, a range of cocktails that will pleasantly surprise with both their taste AND the the eye candy presentation, each in its own unique way! The FOOD……Whilst they do have dishes that you might associate with pub type comfort food (the crackling pork and the chicken wings are both must-try items). This ain’t your typical pub style menu!! And mostly healthy to boot – we are talking about the food 😉 . For a place that is been open in the most recent past, Ask for Fern has been what everyone asks. So you might have to reserve a table to be on the safe side 😀 . Colombo’s night life’s most recent favorite experience should NOT be missed.
